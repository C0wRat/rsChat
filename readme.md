# rsChat

**rsChat** is a lightweight, browser-based chat application written in Rust, designed to allow multiple users to communicate in real time. It supports hosting or joining chat rooms with a simple yet functional user interface. With plans for future enhancements, rsChat is the perfect base for developers looking to expand on a Rust-based chat client.

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Messaging**
rsChat offers real-time messaging where multiple users can connect to a single server. Messages are broadcasted instantly to all users in the chat room, ensuring smooth communication.

### 2. **Host or Join Chat Rooms**
Users can either host their own chat rooms or join an existing session. This flexibility allows for quick and easy communication, whether you're setting up a group chat or joining a pre-existing conversation.

### 3. **Custom Usernames**
Personalize your chat experience by setting a custom username upon joining. This feature allows for easy identification of participants within the chat room.

### 4. **Browser-Based Interface**
The chat client is fully accessible through a modern web browser, eliminating the need for users to install additional software. The intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Planned Features

While rsChat is functional, there are several planned enhancements in the works:

### 1. **End-to-End Encryption**
To ensure privacy and data security, future updates will include end-to-end encryption. This feature will allow messages to be encrypted on the senderâ€™s side and decrypted only by the recipient, keeping the communication private from intermediaries.

### 2. **Message Persistence**
Implement message history, allowing users to review past messages when they reconnect to the chat room.

### 3. **User Authentication**
Integrate user authentication to ensure that only authorized participants can join specific chat rooms, adding a layer of security.
